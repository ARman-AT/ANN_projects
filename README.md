    <h1>Welcome to My Neural Network Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Here you'll find projects demonstrating my abilities in neural network applications.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ARman-AT/ANN_projects/tree/main/Image%20captioning">Image Captioning Project</a>: This project focuses on developing a model that can automatically generate captions for images.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ARman-AT/ANN_projects/tree/main/Object%20Detection">Object Detection Project</a>: This project involves creating a neural network model that can identify and locate objects within images.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ARman-AT/ANN_projects/tree/main/Network%20Optimization">Network Optimization Project</a>: In this project i will decrease the number of parameters of the network without deceases of it's accuracy.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ARman-AT/ANN_projects/tree/main/Transfer%20learning%20for%20chest%20x-ray%20dataset">Transfer Learning Project</a>: In this project i use EfficientNetB2 network which has been trained on imagenet to detect pneumonia from x-ray pictures of the chests</li>
    </ul>
